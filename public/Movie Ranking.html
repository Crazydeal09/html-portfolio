<h1>The Best Movies According to Jeff</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. The Greatest Show Man</h3>
<p> This movie is my favourite. I love about the concept of drama musical and relate with the story</p>

<h3>2. The Avatar</h3>
<p>The story from the beginning until the end never makes me bored. Still the best graphics of all time movie</p>

<h3>3. Avengers infinity war</h3>
<p>Intense action movie and makes your heartbeat and adrenaline up</p>
